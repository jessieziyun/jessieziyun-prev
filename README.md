### Hi, I'm Jessie :-)

I am a designer interested in people, ethics and technology, using visual communication as a means to explore and interrogate the world and ourselves. My work spans multiple disciplines, from branding and book design to photography and coding. Visit my [website](https://www.jessieziyun.com) to see some of my work!

Based in London, I am currently studying Graphic Communication Design with Creative Computing at Central Saint Martins.
